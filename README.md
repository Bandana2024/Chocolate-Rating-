# Chocolate-rating
## Project overview
Chocolate stands as the most favored sweet indulgence globally, celebrated for its exceptional flavor with roots tracing back to ancient times. The Maya revered chocolate, particularly a cocoa beverage prepared with hot water, deeming it the "Food of the Gods." In the United States, it holds a substantial share, with a consumption rate of 59%, surpassing various other confectioneries. Nevertheless, the quality and origin of chocolate can vary significantly. The dataset encompasses expert assessments of over 1,700 distinct chocolate bars, detailing their regional origins, cocoa percentages, chocolate bean varieties, and the specific geographic locations where the beans were cultivated.
I was intrigued to explore deeper into the origins of chocolate, its creation locations, the predominant production percentages, and demand trends. My goal was to uncover fresh insights into chocolate data, which is why I opted for this particular dataset.
## Objective
There is a common assumption that European chocolate is the best globally, and this analysis aims to verify its accuracy. Additionally, the analysis will explore other factors contributing to the best chocolate flavor. 
## Consider the following questions for analysis:

* Which countries constitute the top 20 for producing the highest-rated chocolate bars?
* From which countries do we receive the majority of chocolate samples?
* What are the top 10 most favored types of cocoa beans?
* Is there a correlation between cocoa percentage and the chocolate rating?
* Has there been any change in the rating over time?

Perhaps by addressing these questions, we can introduce new varieties chocolate varieties to the US market, ultimately leading to a conclusion about the existing assumption.
## Data 
The data source was obtained from Kaggle, and you can find the link here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings
There is a file with raw data as well.
### Fact_Table
- Cocoa_percent
- Rating
### Dimension_Tables
- Company  (Maker-if known)
- Specific Bean Origin or Bar Name
- REF
- Review Date
- Company Location
- Bean Type
- Broad Bean Origin
##### Here are the flavor of Cocoa rating system.

* 5= Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
* 4= Premium (Superior flavor development, character and style)
* 3= Satisfactory (3.0) to praiseworthy (3.75) (well made with special qualities)
* 2= Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
* 1= Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)

Each chocolate is evaluated from a combination of both objective qualities and subjective interpretation. A rating here only represents an experience with one bar from one batch. Batch numbers, vintages and review dates are included in the database when known.
